A simple app for practicing WFTDA verbal cues and hand signals

## Intended Audience

This app is designed for new officials to practice the WFTDA verbal cues and hand signals. It can also be useful for
players and fans to build their familiarity with officiating cues and signals.

## How to use the app

'Expressive' mode gives you a verbal cue, waits for you to perform the hand signal, then demonstrates the correct hand signal. 'Receptive' mode gives you a hand signal, waits for you to say the verbal cue, then gives you the correct verbal cue.

The app content is broken down into topic areas. You can include all topics, or limit your practice session to the topics you want to focus on.

After you have made your selections, click the 'Start' button to begin your practice session. Click the 'Restart' button anytime to re-shuffle the clips and start over again.
